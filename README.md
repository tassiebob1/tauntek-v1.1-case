A quick & dirty case for the Tauntek logic IC tester (v1.1 board).

This came about because when my tester, as a bare circuit board, was on the workbench I sometimes found I'd sat it on something conductive
(oops), or I'd draped something conductive (solder usually) over it.  I figured if I didn't put it in a box I'd end up breaking it.

Comes in two parts - the bottom shell, and the top shell.

The top shell has a cutout for the ZIF socket and a finger cutout so the ZIF lever can be accessed.  It also has a cutout for an IDC
connector to be plugged into the serial port connector.

NOTE: This case requires the voltage regulator to be moved to the underside of the board.  If your 7805 is one with a metal back then it'll\
need to be insulated (mine is a fully plastic package).
